\section{Evaluation}

\subsection{Participants}
Fifteen subjects (5 female) participated in the study.
All were a undergraduate or graduate student.
All were active users of technology and 
Each subject took about 30 minutes to complete the study.

\subsection{Phrase Set}
We selected fifty phrases from a collection of five-hundred phrases commonly used for text entry evaluations~\cite{mackenzie2003phrase}.
To allow for cross-comparison to other text entry methods, the corpus doesn't include phrases with punctuation marks.
Non-alphanumeric symbols are rarely considered in text input research~\cite{mackenzie2003phrase} even though some punctuations (. - ' ( ) ") are more frequent than the least common English letter (q)~\cite{malikpunctuation}.
 
SwipeVR allows for the entry of non-alphanumeric symbols using a different interaction technique for words then for punctuation and characters.
To measure the  we add to the phrase set ten phrases for the user to enter that contain non-alphanumeric symbols.
We add five phrases with punctuation marks so the evaluation more closely mimics real-life interactions.
This addition more fully tests the transition time between interaction techniques. 

Copying pre-selected phrase is usually the preferred method for text entry when doing evaluations in a lab setting~\cite{mackenzie2002character, mackenzie2003phrase}.
Although, copying pre-selected entry rates should be regarded differently from true, ``in the wild'' results when the user is composing text instead of transcribing prompted phrases.
In particular, reading a pre-selected phrase has a noticalbly different cadence and certainty that is typically not present in natural voice interactions which leads to what we hypothesize could be an optimistic measurement of voice input.

When the user composes text on their own, there could be substantial thinking time ~\cite{shneiderman2000limits} and other considerations that are difficult to measure.
We only use pre-selected phrases and rely on qualitative feedback to develop a holistic understanding for usability.



\subsection{Measures}
In the field of text entry, several metrics are used to characterize a method's performance ~\cite{wobbrock2007measures,arif2009analysis}.
Here, we discuss the performance metrics we use to evaluate the performance of the input device.  

\subsubsection{Words per Minute}
Words per minute (~$WPM$) is perhaps the most widely reported empirical measure of
text entry performance~\cite{wobbrock2007measures}:

\[ 
WPM={\vert T\vert -1\over S}\times 60\times{1\over 5}. \eqno{\hbox{(1)}}
\]

Where, $S$ is the time in seconds from the first key press to the last, which means that the entry of the first character is never timed, which is the motivation for the "- 1" in the numerator of (1)~\cite{yamada1980historical}.
English words by convention are treated as having five characters~\cite{yamada1980historical}.

\subsubsection{Error Rate}
Error Rate (~$ER$) is the ratio of the total number of incorrect characters in the transcribed text to the length of the transcribed text:

\[
ER={INF\over \vert T\vert }\times 100\%. \eqno{\hbox{(2)}}
\]

Where, Incorrect Not Fixed (~$INF$) is the number of unnoticed incorrect characters in the transcribed text.


\subsection{Experiment \#1 - Standard Keyboard}
To establish a comparison between Slide and other text entry systems, participants entered a series of phrases from the phrase set that only contains lower case letters.
One of our metrics is the learnability of the system so we don't give users practice trials before beginning the actual test.

For each user we conduct twelve sequential sessions.
In each session, a user enters six phrases.
After entering all the phrases with both input methods, the participant filled out
a questionnaire regarding their quantitative feedback on the text entry method.
Finally, subjects were asked for additional comments.

\subsection{Experiment \#2 - Deterministic Input}
In the second experiment we test the secondary keyboard that for the deterministic input of characters.
The secondary keyboard is activated by slowly sliding their finger to a particular key.
Deterministic text entry is needed  for certain proper nouns, passwords, and abbreviations.

In this experiment, we presented with the user with two phrases: one that contained a proper noun and one that contained an abbreviation.
Unlike the above experiment, we did not see effects of learning so did not need multiple evaluation sessions.

\subsubsection{Subjective }
we ask the user to evaluate each entry mechanism on a 5-point Likert Scale (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree).
Additionally, users are  interviewed to further understand the their qualitative experience.


\section{Results}
\subsection{Word Per Minute}
In the first experiment, to calculate the average rate for text entry, we discard the first six sessions and find the steady state rate is 34 WPM with a standard deviation of 6.3.

In the second experiment with the deterministic keyboard the text entry rate is 12 WPM with a standard deviation of 1.8.

\subsection{Error Rate}
The average error rate for text entry was 4\% with a standard deviation of .018.

A curve is fit according to a power law and allow us to speculate about performance in future sessions.
