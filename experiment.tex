\section{Evaluation of Slide}

\subsection{Participants}
Fifteen subjects, 5 female and 15 male, participated in the study.
All were university students and active users of technology.  
Each subject took about 30 minutes to complete the study.

\subsection{Measures}
In the field of text entry, several metrics are used to characterize a method's performance ~\cite{wobbrock2007measures,arif2009analysis}.
Here, we discuss the performance metrics we use to evaluate the performance of the input device.  

\subsubsection{Words per Minute}
Words per minute ($WPM$) is perhaps the most widely reported empirical measure of
text entry performance~\cite{wobbrock2007measures}:

\[ 
WPM={\vert T\vert -1\over S}\times 60\times{1\over 5}. \eqno{\hbox{(1)}}
\]

Where, $S$ is the time in seconds from the first key press to the last, which means that the entry of the first character is never timed, which is the motivation for the ``- 1'' in the numerator of Equation $1$ ~\cite{yamada1980historical}.
English words by convention are treated as having five characters~\cite{yamada1980historical}.

\subsubsection{Error Rate}
Error Rate ($ER$) is the ratio of the total number of incorrect characters in the transcribed text to the length of the transcribed text:

\[
ER={INF\over \vert T\vert }\times 100\%. \eqno{\hbox{(2)}}
\]

Where, Incorrect Not Fixed ($INF$) is the number of unnoticed incorrect characters in the transcribed text.

\subsection{Experiment \#1 - 26-Key Slide Keyboard}

Our first experiment is to measure the speed at which users can type in uncommon English words.  The user has to slide his finger to the specific keys to enter the characters precisely.  There is no auto-correct used in this mode as the primary use is for words that are not in the language model.  

In this experiment, the users were asked to type in two phrases: one that contained a proper noun and one that contained an abbreviation.  We found that the users can enter these phrases with an average entry rate of 12 WPM, with a standard deviation of 1.8.  We observed that practice has no significant effect on improving the speed. 
12 words per minute is a reasonable input rate, considering that input words are uncommon, and errors in entry cannot be corrected automatically. 


\subsection{Experiment \#2 - 6-tile Slide Keyboard}

\subsubsection{Phrase Set}
For this experiment, we selected fifty phrases from a collection of five-hundred phrases commonly used for text entry evaluations~\cite{mackenzie2003phrase}.
Example of phrases from the set are ``video camera with a zoom lens'', ''have a good weekend'', and''what a monkey sees a monkey will do''.
To allow for cross-comparison to other text entry methods, the corpus doesn't include phrases with punctuation marks.
Non-alphanumeric symbols are rarely considered in text input research~\cite{mackenzie2003phrase} even though some punctuations (. - ' ( ) ") are more frequent than the least common English letter,  \textit{q}~\cite{malikpunctuation}.
 
Copying pre-selected phrase is usually the preferred method for text entry when doing evaluations in a lab setting~\cite{mackenzie2002character, mackenzie2003phrase}.
Although, copying pre-selected entry rates should be regarded differently from true, ``in the wild'' results when the user is composing text instead of transcribing prompted phrases.


One of our metrics in the experiment is the learnability of the system so we don't give users practice trials before beginning the actual test.
For each user we conduct twelve sequential sessions.
In each session, a user enters six phrases.
%After entering all the phrases with both input methods, the participant filled out
%a questionnaire regarding their quantitative feedback on the text entry method.
%Finally, subjects were asked for additional comments.

\subsubsection{Subjective }
we ask the user to evaluate each entry mechanism on a 5-point Likert Scale (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree).
Additionally, users are  interviewed to further understand the their qualitative experience.
\end{comment}

The collective learning curve is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:learnability}.
The mean starting rate for all users was 18 WPM.
Every user improved their WPM rate by at least 20\% from their starting rate.
To calculate the steady state average rate for text entry, we discard the first six sessions and find the steady state rate is 34 WPM with a standard deviation of 6.3. The average error rate for text entry was 4\% with a standard deviation of .018.
