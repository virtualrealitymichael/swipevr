\begin{abstract}
Text input in VR is challenging because of the latency in visual feedback and the lack of proprioception.  Our design Slide, a virtual keyboard that requires only a track pad, is based on 3 concepts: (1) relative vectors: to enter a character, the user slides from what is assumed to be the center of the keyboard to the key of interest.  (2) directional, with error correction: all keys are grouped in 6 tiles, and the user only has to slide in the direction of the tile containing the key.  A Bayesian word recommender determines the word entered. (3) Intention-based hybrid keyboard: the keyboard automatically switches between the 26-key and 6-tile keyboard based on the user's finger movements.   Our user study suggests that Slide can be learned quickly, and delivers an average text entry speed of 34 words per minute with an error rate of 4\%.

 is able to be learned quickly by beginners and supports eyes-free entry by experts.  The participants are able to type an average text entry speed of Y WPM with an error rate of Z\%.  These results show that text entry is similar to that of a mobile phone keyboard but error correction and editing, the most time consuming step, is greatly improved.
